Make some Div boxes with text using Bootstrap5 Jumbotron properties from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>

1) A <b>jumbotron</b> was introduced in <b>Bootstrap 3</b> as a big padded box for calling extra attention to some special content or information.

2) <b>Jumbotrons</b> are no longer supported in  <b>Bootstrap 5 </b>. However, you can use a  <b>div></b> element and add special helper classes together with a color class to achieve the same effect.
